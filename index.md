I was born towards the end of the last century, on the first months of the year
1997 (Jan 12th) on a city located at the hearth of Mexico (Actopan, Hidalgo).

At the age of 8 I had contact with my first PC, an old _frankensteined_ machine
that came with the dreaded Windows ME preinstalled whick I used to play
emulated SNES games.

I have a BS degree in applied mathematics which I don't use for anything useful.
